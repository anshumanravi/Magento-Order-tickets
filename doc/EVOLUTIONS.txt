Principal ideas for evolutions of this extension:

- Have a better status management with possibility of defining status for
specific action

- Possibility in FO for customer to edit his own messages

- More straightforward relations between tickets for being able to indicate to
which message an answer is dedicated

- Possibility of editing/deleting every message in BO

- Notifying customer by email about a new answer
- Possibility for a customer to attach a file to his message
- Possibility to enter a customer message through BO (for example keep trace of an email of phone call)
